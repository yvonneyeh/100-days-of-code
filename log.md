### Day 1: Thursday, January 7, 2021

Hackbright Day 4!

**Today's Progress**: 
Lectures: list slicing, computer memory, 
Labs: building a calculator

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed the computer memory lecture, I learned a lot of info that seemed vaguely familiar but now I can put a name to. Feeling confident with list slicing, it was nice to teach my pair programming partner when she had some trouble while navigating while I was driving â€“ helped me to solidify my own understanding of the concepts in application.

### Day 2: Friday, January 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
Lectures: collections
Labs: data structures - working with lists, tuples, sets

**Thoughts** I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of the theory, but struggling a lot with applying new knowledge while actually sitting down to code. Didn't have a chance to take a lunch break because my pair programming partner and I were so close to completing the lab. I need to remind myself to take more breaks.

### Day 2: Saturday, January 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Skills Assessments! Coded for about 6 hours!


**Thoughts** Last night I had a dream about git. In my dream I kept typing into terminal, "git init" and "git push origin master" and nothing happened at all. Did my first skills assessment, the first problem took me about 40 minutes to do and I was really struggling, but once I got it, the 2nd only took me 1 minute to do! It was good to take breaks between problems to refresh my brain. I didn't necessarily think about the problems while I was taking a break but it helped to get my mental state ready to code.
