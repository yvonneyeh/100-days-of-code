### Day 0:

Will come back and add comments about the first week of Hackbright!


### Day 1: Thursday, January 7, 2021

Hackbright Day 4!

**Today's Progress**: 
Lectures: list slicing, computer memory, 
Labs: building a calculator

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed the computer memory lecture, I learned a lot of info that seemed vaguely familiar but now I can put a name to. Feeling confident with list slicing, it was nice to teach my pair programming partner when she had some trouble while navigating while I was driving â€“ helped me to solidify my own understanding of the concepts in application.

### Day 2: Friday, January 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
Lectures: collections
Labs: data structures - working with lists, tuples, sets

**Thoughts** I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of the theory, but struggling a lot with applying new knowledge while actually sitting down to code. Didn't have a chance to take a lunch break because my pair programming partner and I were so close to completing the lab. I need to remind myself to take more breaks.

### Day 3: Saturday, January 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Skills Assessments! Coded for about 6 hours!


**Thoughts** Last night I had a dream about git. In my dream I kept typing into terminal, "git init" and "git push origin master" and nothing happened at all. Did my first skills assessment, the first problem took me about 40 minutes to do and I was really struggling, but once I got it, the 2nd only took me 1 minute to do! It was good to take breaks between problems to refresh my brain. I didn't necessarily think about the problems while I was taking a break but it helped to get my mental state ready to code.

### Day 4: Sunday, January 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: practicing code refactoring, comments/docstrings, and commiting to git


**Thoughts** Not a lot of new coding, mostly just reviewing and editing. Feeling good after my first assessment. Pushed to github classroom for the first time and the mobile UI is interesting.

### Day 5: Monday, January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: started using dictionaries for the first time, learned some new python tools


**Thoughts** Struggled quite a bit with dictionaries. They make sense in theory, but applying the knowledge was really challenging today. I had a lot of trouble commiting to git for some reason. Kept encountering errors and felt quite frustrated while working with my pair programming partners today. My internet wasn't super steady and it was difficult to work together. I didn't feel like I got a good practice run with the labs. Going to do them again by myself tonight.
