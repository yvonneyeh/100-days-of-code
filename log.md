# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:
##### (delete me or comment me out)
Will come back and add comments about the first week of Hackbright!


### Day 1: Thursday, January 7, 2021

Hackbright Day 4!

**Today's Progress**: 
Lectures: list slicing, computer memory, 
Labs: building a calculator

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed the computer memory lecture, I learned a lot of info that seemed vaguely familiar but now I can put a name to. Feeling confident with list slicing, it was nice to teach my pair programming partner when she had some trouble while navigating while I was driving â€“ helped me to solidify my own understanding of the concepts in application.

### Day 2: Friday, January 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
Lectures: collections
Labs: data structures - working with lists, tuples, sets

**Thoughts** I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of the theory, but struggling a lot with applying new knowledge while actually sitting down to code. Didn't have a chance to take a lunch break because my pair programming partner and I were so close to completing the lab. I need to remind myself to take more breaks.

### Day 3: Saturday, January 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Skills Assessments! Coded for about 6 hours!


**Thoughts** Last night I had a dream about git. In my dream I kept typing into terminal, "git init" and "git push origin master" and nothing happened at all. Did my first skills assessment, the first problem took me about 40 minutes to do and I was really struggling, but once I got it, the 2nd only took me 1 minute to do! It was good to take breaks between problems to refresh my brain. I didn't necessarily think about the problems while I was taking a break but it helped to get my mental state ready to code.

### Day 4: Sunday, January 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: practicing code refactoring, comments/docstrings, and commiting to git


**Thoughts** Not a lot of new coding, mostly just reviewing and editing. Feeling good after my first assessment. Pushed to github classroom for the first time and the mobile UI is interesting.

### Day 5: Monday, January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: started using dictionaries for the first time, learned some new python tools


**Thoughts** Struggled quite a bit with dictionaries. They make sense in theory, but applying the knowledge was really challenging today. I had a lot of trouble commiting to git for some reason. Kept encountering errors and felt quite frustrated while working with my pair programming partners today. My internet wasn't super steady and it was difficult to work together. I didn't feel like I got a good practice run with the labs. Going to do them again by myself tonight.

### Day 6: Tuesday, January 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Markov chains, more dictionaries, UNIX command line programs, shell environments.


**Thoughts** Markov chains were very interesting. I see a lot of fun application scenarios for this on Twitter. Got to practice a lot more with creating a dictonary of Markov chains with my pair programming partner. I thought my partner and I were very compatible in skill level and communication, and it was really great to work with her for both of the lab sessions today. We made a lot of progress together and figured out how to debug together. The lecture about UNIX command line programs and shell environments totally went over my head. I have the knowledge in my brain now (kinda), but I have no idea what a use case scenario would be yet. A lot of people seemed to have trouble with the homework from last night, like I did. I'm still not feeling very confident with dictionaries, definitely need to practice working with them a bit more until I can feel comfortable with them.

### Day 7: Wednesday, January 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: virtual environments, class attributes, object-oriented drawing, "if dunder name equals dunder main" (__mifflin__ lol) ðŸ“„ 


**Thoughts** Every day we seem to learn something brand new that I have no idea what to envision as its use case. Trying to trust in the process and remember that the information will be useful later. Felt really tired today, didn't sleep well last night and found myself spacing off during lecture and making lots of errors in my notes. My VM was also crashing a lot or disconnecting/hanging, the only way I could resolve it was to shut down the VM and force quitâ€¦

### Day 8: Thursday, January 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: learned more about superclasses/subclasses, dry code, and got to practice using classes more

**Thoughts** I'm starting to understand classes. I think I may have accidentally read too far on the lab from Classes Part 1, and was confused, but now everything makes a lot more sense. I felt confident during pair programming today and felt like I understood what I was doing. My pair and I even managed to do some of the further study work that was optional because we finished our lab early! Even though I don't think our communication was smooth 100% of the time, it felt like the smoothest, and most streamlined lab yet, simply because there weren't many issues that were popping up. Just need to remind myself to run code often to test if it breaks, rather than waiting too long and not being able to figure out why it breaks. Because it will break, eventually, until I can fix it :)

### Day 9: Friday, January 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Career discussion, self-study, review

**Thoughts** Today I met with my advisor for the first time. He was very reassuring and reminded me that feeling lost is normal in a bootcamp. It's an instense learning environment and natural to feel like I'm behind. He also said it's normal to feel like I don't understand something fully until a few days or weeks later after you have an opportunity to apply the concepts in practice. I asked if he had practice problems for me, but he recommended I just go back to the old labs and homework assignments and redo them. We all an opportunity to review some work on our own, I want to be better about self-guided studying and review. I didn't feel like I utilized my time super effectively. Next Friday, I think I'll try to stay in a study hall and maybe work with (or around) others so we can bounce ideas off each other and keep ourselves motivated.
